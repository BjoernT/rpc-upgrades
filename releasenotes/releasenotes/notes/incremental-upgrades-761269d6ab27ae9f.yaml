    Add scripts for testing incremental upgrades from Ubuntu 16.04 starting at
    Newton all the way to Queens. (Experimental)  Testing currently deploys a
    Newton AIO on Xenial, and then incrementally upgrades to Ocata, to Pike, to
    Queens.  Gating job in place to periodically test this path.
