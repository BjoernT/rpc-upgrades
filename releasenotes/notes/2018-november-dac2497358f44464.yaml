    Leaps to Newton r14.19.0

    Switches leapfrog upgrades to use openstack-ansible from the
    https://github.com/rcbops/openstack-ansible repo instead of
    upstream git.openstack.org.  This allows us to make maintenance
    changes to the EOL branches used in the Leapfrog process.
    Dependencies break over time and in order to maintain a working
    leapfrog toolset, the older openstack-ansible release branches
    occasionally need to be modified to allow the leapfrog tool to
    continue working.  This is controlled by the OSA_REPO_URL in
    openstack-ansible-ops leapfrog tooling.

    Incrementals now utilize variables from rpc-openstack for each
    release to ensure that the version we're upgrading to is in line
    with the version of RPC-O that we support.  This ensures we're
    using the same OSA release as an RPC-O release and copies the
    necessary group_vars over when incrementing up for each version.
