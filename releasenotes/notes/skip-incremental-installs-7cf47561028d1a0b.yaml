   Incremental N2Q upgrades now default to skipping the actual software installing
   steps during the Ocata and Pike stages.  This is an attempt to increase upgrade
   speed.  If however, you would like to run full Ocata and Pike upgrades, be sure
   to set `export SKIP_INSTALL='no'" before running the upgrade.
