    Adds Ansible Vault support for decryption and encryption of
    OpenStack secrets files during a leapfrog upgrade.  To enable
    `export ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE=path_to_vault_pass_file`
    before running a leapfrog.  The password files user_secrets.yml
    user_osa_secrets.yml, and user_rpco_secrets.yml will all be
    decrypted during the process if present and re-encrypted at the
    end of the leapfrog.
